# Beacon-App

Beacon helps make social gatherings easier to locate with close friends. Users can place information about their plans into a map that can be seen by friends.

Users can connect to friends and create posts that display the location, time, and images of their plans which can then be seen by other friends. Friends will see available options for social gatherings and can decide which ones to attend.
